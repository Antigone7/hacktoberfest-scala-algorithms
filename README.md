### The Rules of the HacktoberFest
 To get a T-shirt, you must make five pull requests between October 1–31 in any timezone. Pull requests can be to any public repo on GitHub, not just the ones we’ve highlighted. The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.
 
 You can check your progress of HacktoberFest <a target="_blank" href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/stats/">here</a>.
 
 
 <strong>Please also note that pull requests marked as spam will not be entitled for a T-shirt</strong>


### Development Rules

- Each implemented piece of code must **not have any external dependency**
- Implemented algorithms are allowed to use only data structures contained inside the library
- Each algorithm should be applicable (if possible) to all the structures inside the library
- Every piece of code produced here will be released under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](LICENSE)
